#  The Sparks Foundation Tasks

This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- **Internship Category** - Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration** - 2 Months ( Jan 2021 - Feb 2021)
- **Internship Type** - Remote

In this internship, we were provided a total of 6 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 6 tasks within the given time-frame.



### # Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w)
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?



### # Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)

1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use R or Python or perform this task.
3. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j](https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j)



### # Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
3. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)



### # Task-4 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)

1. Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
2. Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
3. Download historical stock prices from [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1)
4. Download textual (news) data from [https://bit.ly/36fFPI6](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6)
5. Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.



### # Task-5 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner & Intermediate)

1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
3. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
5. Dataset link :[https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl)
6. Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations.



### # Task-6 : Timeline Analysis : Covid-19 (Level - Advanced)

1. Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid 19 cases in your country or any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc)
2. Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story
3. Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid 19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts
4. Use Tableau or Power BI for this task
5. Screen record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations.
6. Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on [https://bit.ly/30d2gdi](https://bit.ly/30d2gdi)
